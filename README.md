Thank you for visiting our Github. Take a look above, you will notice some tabs to help navigate our GitHub page. This is the main page a.k.a the "Code" tab.

Next to it, you should see an "Issues" tab. Here you can report bugs, request changes, recommend new content, and communicate in general with the Devs to Minecraft. The only other tabs to worry about are the "Projects" tab, and the "Wiki" tab. The projects tab will show you all our completed work, current work, and pending work so you know what we plan to work on, when, and if it's done. The Wiki tab is SUPER useful to new users on the server. We will slowly be making a complete guide on EVERYTHING you might need. How to trade, how to use shops, banks, portals, our different gamemodes, the rules, etc. It's a Wiki just for our server!

Thanks again for stopping in, we have worked hard to bring you a lot of tranparency and ability to control the server you play on. We hope you take advantage of the features we are offering and look forward to communicating further with our amazing community.
